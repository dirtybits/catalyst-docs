## Webwallets

We are now listed on SP web wallet, now miners can mine on Spookypool or any other pool directly to this web wallet and then withdraw to exchange. This will help people who don't want to deal with CLI wallets and blockchain sync.

## CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko

We are working on getting catalyst listed on these platforms, though we need to fit some requirements before they add us. One of which is to be listed on more high volume exchanges.
