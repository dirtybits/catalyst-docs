# Catalyst Overview


`Catalyst`  — is an anonymous platform, based on blockchain distributed
network, intended to make almost instant payments
with extremely low commission fees.

> It's a tool for building distributed applications.

The payment system is only one of many use cases it can be used for.

`Catalyst` was created by the community — for the community.

We do not recognize I.C.Os, Master Nodes, stacking
and technical emission a.k.a.  (premine).

Every participant of the consensus  — has equal rights.

Developers and miners do not have any preferences
or special treatment and are regular members of the collective.

The main goal of Catalyst is to create an infrastructure for Dapps
(decentralized applications), in order to give independent and creative
people a chance to adapt in a constantly changing world,
and get back control of their privacy and security.

We don't have a central leadership, all the decisions regarding the
project development are made exclusively by the community!

In our [Discord](https://discord.gg/byKYDyb) channel, you can always find any help and
friendly support, meet new like-minded friends and
just spend some time with a lot of fun.

Catalyst is a non-profit open-source community!
If you want to get involved in project's life, just PM us.
We'll be very happy to have you on our team
and will appreciate any help!
