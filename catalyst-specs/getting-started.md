# Getting Started

It's extremely easy to start using Catalyst!
If you are comfortable with console applications just download the official CLI:

- [Windows CLI v0.4.0.3](https://github.com/catalystdevelopment/catalyst/releases/download/v0.4.0.3/catalyst-cli-windows-v0.4.0.3.zip)
- [Linux CLI v0.4.0.3](https://github.com/catalystdevelopment/catalyst/releases/download/v0.4.0.3/catalyst-cli-lunux-v0.4.0.3.tar.gz)


Though if you prefer the graphic user interface, we released nice GUI wallets for you, as well:

- [Windows CatalystLedger-v2.0.0](https://github.com/catalystdevelopment/catalyst-gui-wallet/releases/download/v2.0.0-chukwa/CatalystLedger-v2.0.0-win-setup.exe)
- [Linux CatalystLedger-v2.0.0](https://github.com/catalystdevelopment/catalyst-gui-wallet/releases/download/v2.0.0-chukwa/CatalystLedger-v2.0.0-linux.AppImage)


We also have a `Catalyst` Paper Wallet!

>This will make it easy for you to introduce your friends and family to Catalyst by showing them how, by writing down and protecting their mnemonic seed, they will always have access to their funds!
