# Sponsors funding

The best thing that sponsors, of a decentralized project, can do is to provide transparency to its community about their financial movements.

That’s because people that may have inside information tend to act based on that and this can give outsiders the shaft. We don’t like the shaft.

We’ve decided to give full transparency, all project donations are totally public and can be traced through the funding system.

Saying this, if you want to invest in Catalyst, and become a member of our community, we are always open for discussion.
